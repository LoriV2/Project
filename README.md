# Web Chat Application

This project was developed as part of a class assignment during my third year of technical school. The main objective was to create a web application using **Laravel** for the backend and **CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend.

## Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to register and log in.
- **Real-time Chat**: The application integrates chat functionality using [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels/).

## Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Laravel
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Real-time Communication**: Pusher Channels

Please note that this project was developed when I was still in high school, and while it fulfills the assignment requirements, it is not a polished or professional product. However, it demonstrates my ability to integrate real-time features and manage user authentication in a web application.

Feel free to explore, but keep in mind that it was a learning project!
